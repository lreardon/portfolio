# Personal Portfolio

Welcome! You've found the source code for my portfolio. If you're here, you should know that I don't put too much effort into this site -- just the minimum to keep the bio updated and to showcase whatever projects I'd like to showcase at the moment.

One day I will restructure the site to include a section for writing and a more concise and complete list of personal projects, and possibly individual sections on professional work. For now, all that sounds a bit tedious and I'd rather work on the actual projects rather than talk about them!
